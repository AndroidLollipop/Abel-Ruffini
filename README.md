# Computer aided proof of Abel-Ruffini (based on Arnold's loop commutator proof)
Consider the paths traced by the coefficients of a monic degree 5 polynomial with distinct roots when the roots are smoothly permuted while remaining distinct.  
Since the coefficients are continuous functions of the roots, they must trace continuous paths.
